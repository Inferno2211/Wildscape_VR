# Team Code Ignite - Nandankanan Zoo VR Experience

**Introduction:**

Hi, this is team Code Ignite, and we've recreated the Nandankanan Zoo from Odisha.

The Nandankanan Zoo in Odisha is home to a diverse range of wildlife. However, many people cannot visit in person due to geographical constraints, time limitations, or physical disabilities. Moreover, natural disasters, lockdowns, and other restrictions hinder access to this natural wonder. Wildscape, our VR zoo, addresses these issues head-on.

With the launch of Apple Vision Pro and Oculus Quest, VR is emerging as the next big leap in technology.

**Key Features:**

**Immersive Environment:** Users step into a virtual Nandankanan Zoo, complete with realistic animal habitats, lush landscapes, and informative exhibits.

**Realistic Animals:** We painstakingly recreated the animals in high fidelity using Unreal Engine, and the animals are powered by AI, offering a wide range of animations and interactions. Additionally, visitors can get up close to them without any danger.

**Interactive Learning:** Wildscape is not just about sightseeing. It's an educational tool, offering users the opportunity to learn about the animals, their habitats, and conservation efforts through interactive exhibits.

**Accessibility:** By using VR technology, we've made the Nandankanan Zoo accessible to everyone, regardless of physical location or mobility issues.

**Business Model and Future Scope:**

Wildscape offers a sustainable revenue model. The zoo can charge a small fee for an immersive tour. With a large number of virtual guests, it can boost the revenue of the zoo and reinvest it in conservation efforts.

**The Impact:**

- **Education:** We're fostering a love for wildlife and environmental conservation through immersive education.

- **Inclusivity:** Wildscape ensures that everyone, regardless of their circumstances, can connect with nature and wildlife.

**Future Plans:**

Now onto the future scope. We had also planned a few more features, but due to time constraints, we weren't able to implement them.

- **Expansion:** We plan to expand the variety of wildlife in our zoo. Currently, we have about 5-6 species, but the actual zoo has over 30. We are planning to add the remaining species, which will allow us to explore the full diversity of the Nandankanan Zoo from the comfort of our home.

- **AI Narrator:** As you approach each exhibit, the narrator will engage you with fascinating facts about the animals, their habits, and conservation efforts.

- **Expansion Beyond:** This concept can be extended to other zoos and natural wonders, so the possibilities are endless.

Wildscape solves a real problem, has a viable business model, and makes a positive impact, and it is redefining the future of eco-adventures.
